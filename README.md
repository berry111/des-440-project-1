DES 440 Project 1

For my project I wanted to tell the story of John Henry using the lyrics of the Johnny Cash song by the same name. There's many other versions of the song, but since that was the one that I was first acquainted with, I decided to use it.
The illustrations are supposed to mimic folk art from the mid-1800's, and be very simple so that they also hold up with today's simple preferences.
Wireframes and Style tiles were created using Photoshop, and the initial style tile illustrations were made in Illustrator.
Illustrations for the website were sketched and colored digitally in photoshop using the colors determined on the style tile.
